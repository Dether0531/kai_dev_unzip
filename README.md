The Unzipper
The Unzipper extracts .zip and .rar archives or .gz/tar.gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.rar/.tar.gz/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available). As of version 0.1.0 it also supports creating archives.

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.

Requirements
PHP 5.3 and newer (If you still run PHP < 5.6 you should consider updating PHP. These old PHP versions do not get any security updates and your site may be vulnerable.)

Usage
Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
In Browser type URL to unzipper.php
